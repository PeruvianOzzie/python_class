# Currency_convert



## Getting started

The application should work just by creating a virtual environment and calling the methods. 

Two methods available:

- get_exchange_rate wich requires two parameters: Source exchange currency code (i.e. USD) and target exchange currency code (i.e. PEN)
- convert_currency wich requires three parameters: Amount to exchange, Source exchange currency code (i.e. USD) and target exchange currency code (i.e. PEN)
